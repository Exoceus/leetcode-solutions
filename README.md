# Solutions to Leetcode Problems

> All solutions in this repository are strictly my own - i.e. I wrote every single line of code in this repository (apart from the solution boilerplate).

## Structure

Multiple solutions are generally given per problem. These are generally in order of most naive/easiest solution at the start (i.e. the one that seemed most intuitive or straightforward to me) and more complex ones towards the end. Although all given solutions are ones that passed the Leetcode timing requirements.

## Languages

If I am comfortable with the underlying idea of a question, I try to use C++ to force myself to be more verbose. Whereas, I will try to use Python where I don't feel like I am fully comfortable with the question. Thus, for harder questions, I try to do it first in Python and then come back and do it in C++.

## Labels

Functions are labelled in the form of a single word comment in the line before the function declaration:

- `blind`: I didn't use any sort of hint or look at anyone else's solutions for this solution
- `inspired`: While I wrote the solution myself, I did take a partial or full look at a hint or someone else's solution.
